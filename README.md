The application of active learning in drift detection

1.run.py：Main file for program execution.

2.data_handler.py： Data processing file.

3.mark_data.py：Data mark file

4.config.py：Parameter configuration file.

First, run data_handler.py to preprocess the data. Then, run run.py to complete the drift detection task within the active learning framework.

Please note: This includes some data and a simplified model to support execution. Users can generate data and train a base model according to datageneration.py in Type-LDA.
